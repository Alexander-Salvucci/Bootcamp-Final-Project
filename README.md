# Bootcamp-Final-Project

Each file is for a different part of the final project. First, we set up alerts to test during the penetration test. Then, we attempted a penetration test on a vulnerable Wordpress webserver. The final part was looking at some wireshark packet captures to look for suspicious activity.

<!-- Additionally, the slides for our final project presentation is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mn6s619dX55a_pz_WUnqyG0jNi2VJkAWY7JppmBW2nU/edit#slide=id.g8bd883d690_0_46 -->
